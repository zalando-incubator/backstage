# Backstage Search

## What is it?

Backstage Search lets you find the right information you are looking for in the
Backstage ecosystem.

## Features

- A federated, faceted search, searching across all entities registered in your
  Backstage instance.

- A search that lets you plug in your own search engine of choice.

- A standardized search API where you can choose to index other plugins data.

## Use Cases

#### Backstage Search V.0

- As a software engineer I should be able to navigate to a search page and
  search for entities registered in the Software Catalog.
- As a software engineer I should be able to use the search input field in the
  sidebar to search for entities registered in the Software Catalog.
- As a software engineer I should be able to see the number of results my search
  returned.
- As a software engineer I should be able to filter on metadata (kind,
  lifecycle) when I’ve performed a search.
- As a software engineer I should be able to hide the filters if I don’t need to
  use them.

#### Backstage Search V.1

- As a software engineer I should be able to get a match of a search on all
  entity metadata (e.g. owner, name, description, kind).
- As an integrator I should not have to plug in any search engine, instead I can
  use the out of the box in-memory indexing process to index entities and their
  metadata registered in the Software Catalog.

#### Backstage Search V.2

- As an integrator I should be able to spin up an instance of ElasticSearch.
- As an integrator I should be able to define a ElasticSearch cluster in my
  app_config.yaml where my data gets indexed to.

more to come...

#### Backstage Search V.3

- As a contributor I should be able to integrate plugin data to the indexing
  process of Backstage Search by using the standardized API.
- As a software engineer I should be able to search for all content (for
  example, entities, metadata, documentation) in Backstage search.
