## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8804e8981: Using @backstage/integration package for GitHub/GitLab/Azure tokens and request options.

  Most probably you do not have to make any changes in the app because of this change.
  However, if you are using the `DirectoryPreparer` or `CommonGitPreparer` exported by
  `@backstage/techdocs-common` package, you now need to add pass in a `config` (from `@backstage/config`)
  instance as argument.

  ```
  <!-- Before -->
      const directoryPreparer = new DirectoryPreparer(logger);
      const commonGitPreparer = new CommonGitPreparer(logger);
  <!-- Now -->
      const directoryPreparer = new DirectoryPreparer(config, logger);
      const commonGitPreparer = new CommonGitPreparer(config, logger);
  ```

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a8573e53b: techdocs-backend: Simplified file, removing individual preparers and generators.
  techdocs-backend: UrlReader is now available to use in preparers.

  In your Backstage app, `packages/backend/plugins/techdocs.ts` file has now been simplified,
  to remove registering individual preparers and generators.

  Please update the file when upgrading the version of `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package.

  ```typescript
  const preparers = await Preparers.fromConfig(config, {
    logger,
    reader,
  });

  const generators = await Generators.fromConfig(config, {
    logger,
  });

  const publisher = await Publisher.fromConfig(config, {
    logger,
    discovery,
  });
  ```

  You should be able to remove unnecessary imports, and just do

  ```typescript
  import {
    createRouter,
    Preparers,
    Generators,
    Publisher,
  } from '@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend';
  ```

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- dae4f3983: _Breaking changes_

  1. Added option to use Google Cloud Storage as a choice to store the static generated files for TechDocs.
     It can be configured using `techdocs.publisher.type` option in `app-config.yaml`.
     Step-by-step guide to configure GCS is available here https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/using-cloud-storage
     Set `techdocs.publisher.type` to `'local'` if you want to continue using local filesystem to store TechDocs files.

  2. `techdocs.builder` is now required and can be set to `'local'` or `'external'`. (Set it to `'local'` for now, since CI/CD build
     workflow for TechDocs will be available soon (in few weeks)).
     If builder is set to 'local' and you open a TechDocs page, `techdocs-backend` will try to generate the docs, publish to storage and
     show the generated docs afterwords.
     If builder is set to `'external'`, `techdocs-backend` will only fetch the docs and will NOT try to generate and publish. In this case of `'external'`,
     we assume that docs are being built in the CI/CD pipeline of the repository.
     TechDocs will not assume a default value for `techdocs.builder`. It is better to explicitly define it in the `app-config.yaml`.

  3. When configuring TechDocs in your backend, there is a difference in how a new publisher is created.

  ```
  ---  const publisher = new LocalPublish(logger, discovery);
  +++  const publisher = Publisher.fromConfig(config, logger, discovery);
  ```

  Based on the config `techdocs.publisher.type`, the publisher could be either Local publisher or Google Cloud Storage publisher.

  4. `techdocs.storageUrl` is now a required config. Should be `http://localhost:7000/api/techdocs/static/docs` in most setups.

  5. Parts of `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` have been moved to a new package `@backstage/techdocs-common` to generate docs. Also to publish docs
     to-and-fro between TechDocs and a storage (either local or external). However, a Backstage app does NOT need to import the `techdocs-common` package -
     app should only import `@backstage/plugin-techdocs` and `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend`.

  _Patch changes_

  1. See all of TechDocs config options and its documentation https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/configuration

  2. Logic about serving static files and metadata retrieval have been abstracted away from the router in `techdocs-backend` to the instance of publisher.

  3. Removed Material UI Spinner from TechDocs header. Spinners cause unnecessary UX distraction.
     Case 1 (when docs are built and are to be served): Spinners appear for a split second before the name of site shows up. This unnecessarily distracts eyes because spinners increase the size of the Header. A dot (.) would do fine. Definitely more can be done.
     Case 2 (when docs are being generated): There is already a linear progress bar (which is recommended in Storybook).
